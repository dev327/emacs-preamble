#+TITLE: Emacs' Preamble's Package Configuration

* On Demand Installation
   I have added some convenient functions to install a package, only when it is explicitely told to
   do so, which means that instead of writing a list of our packages (that need to be installed and
   checked on every run of Emacs) in this section, we are now able to =install= them right along
   with the rest of their configuration. This is called *On Demand Installation* of the packages.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; on-demand installation of a package
     (defun preamble/require-package (package &optional min-version no-refresh)
       "Install given PACKAGE, optionally requiring MIN-VERSION.
       If NO-REFRESH is non-nil, the available package lists will not be
       re-downloaded in order to locate PACKAGE."
       (if (package-installed-p package min-version)
           t
         (if (or (assoc package package-archive-contents) no-refresh)
             (package-install package)
           (progn
             (package-refresh-contents)
             (preamble/require-package package min-version t)))))

     ;; on-demand installation of multiple packages
     (defun preamble/require-packages(packages-list)
       "Install packages from a given PACKAGES-LIST, using `preamble-require-package' function."
       (mapc #'preamble/require-package packages-list))
   #+END_SRC
